# About This Blog

This site documents my personal homelab projects, from initial setup to troubleshooting and upgrades.  
I'll share my configs, diagrams, and lessons learned so I can track my progress and maybe help others building their own labs.  

**Who am I?**  
I'm Tim Smith, a CIS major at Kutztown University experimenting with networking, virtualization, and automation in my free time.
