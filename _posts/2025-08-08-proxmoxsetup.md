title: "Configuring Proxmox"
---

I can't lie, I strugged the first time setting up Proxmox back in February 2025. I didn't research enough about virtualizaiton, and unfortunately wiped my main SSD storage off of my Windows 11 device, thinking I could dual boot. Mistake learned. Thankfully it was a new PC I had built the month prior, so I didn't lose much data.
